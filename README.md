## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Heart disease is a major cause of mortality worldwide. Early prediction enables timely treatment and prevention.  
This project uses **Machine Learning algorithms** to predict the presence of heart disease from health metrics like age, cholesterol level, and maximum heart rate.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Analyze and visualize the dataset.
- Build predictive ML models.
- Compare accuracy across different algorithms.
- Identify the most effective prediction model.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source:** CSV file containing **303 rows** and **14 columns**.
- **Features:** Age, cholesterol level, maximum heart rate, resting blood pressure, etc.
- **Target Variable:**  
  - `1` â†’ Heart disease present  
  - `0` â†’ No heart disease  
- **Missing Values:** None.
- **Data Types:** Numerical.
